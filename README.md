# Edge-Deployed ML for Industrial Control Systems Security

## Overview
Research paper investigating hardware-based machine learning for detecting cybersecurity anomalies in resource-constrained Industrial Control Systems.

## Key Findings
- 90.8% detection accuracy on Raspberry Pi 4B testbed
- 4.96ms processing time (real-time detection)
- Isolation Forest + TensorFlow Lite on edge devices
